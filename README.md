# Overveiw

A side project for side projects.

## why does it exist??

Because I’ve abandoned more side projects than I care to admit… so I made another side project to track them all.
Yes, I built a project manager to manage my inability to manage projects. ¯\(ツ)/¯

## what I'm getting from this??

I’m using it as an excuse to:

- Deep dive into primitives & triggers (thanks Radix & shadcn)
- Learn how to keep React components small, modular, and reusable
- Pretend I know what “good architecture” means

## Status

The app that helps me track unfinished projects… is itself unfinished.
